## About René

He recently obtained _PhD in Earth Sciences_ from the University of Trieste Joint PhD Programme, Earth Science and Fluid Mechanics [ESFM](https://web.units.it/dottorato/esfm/) in Trieste, Italy. 

His main research interest is on evaluating the response of the ocean to anomalous surface fluxes in terms of ocean heat uptake and circulation changes, with particular focus on the Shallow Wind-driven Overturning Circulation.

He is originally from Ensenada Baja California México, where he graduated from the Faculty of Marine Science [FCM](http://fcm.ens.uabc.mx/) at the Autonomous University of Baja California with a _BSc degree in Oceanography_. 

He also held a _Master of Science in Physical Oceanography_ from the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education [CICESE](https://www.cicese.edu.mx/).

He had worked as a scientific assistant for The Gulf of México Research Consortium [CIGoM](https://cigom.org/en/) and the Mexican Center for Innovation in Ocean Energy [CEMIE](https://cemieoceano.mx/).

Schematic representations of the Pacific Ocean Shallow Wind-driven Meridional Overturning Circulation. (a) The time-mean and zonally-integrated Meridional Overturning Circulation. The time-mean isopycnal field (gray contours) and mean mixed layer depth (red line) are also shown. Both upper poleward and lower equatorward branches are represented by horizontal white arrows. Equatorial upwelling and subtropical downwelling flow required to close overturning circulation are also shown (upward and downward white arrows). (b) Bird's eye view of the time-mean meridional circulation and different branches of the meridional overturn. The warm upper poleward Ekman transport (white arrows), the cold lower equatorward geostrophic interior transport (black arrows) and the subsurface Western Boundary Current contribution to the upper poleward transport (gray arrows) on the western side of the basin, are shown. The equatorial upwelling and the subtropical downwelling are represented by the white upward arrow and by the white downward arrows, respectively. Contours represent the time-mean zonal wind stress. (c) Schematics of the zonal section of the Shallow Overturning Circulation inside the Subtropical Gyre, for the Northern Hemisphere across latitude 24N. The same applies to the Southern Hemisphere but inverting the signs. The Schematic is divided into surface poleward transport, the Western Boundary Current transport (WBC), and the interior equatorward transport. Balance inside the overturning cell excludes transport within deeper levels of the WBC (shaded area), which flows outside the gyre towards the Subpolar region.

Pacific Ocean meridional mass and heat transports, in both Southern and Northern Hemispheres. (a) Shallow Overturning Cell schematics inside the Subtropical Gyre. Meridional transport inside the cell is divided into surface poleward transport, the Western Boundary Current transport (WBC) and the interior equatorward transport. Balance inside the overturning cell excludes transport within deeper levels of the WBC (shaded area), which flows outside of the gyre towards the subpolar region. In the Northern Hemisphere, mass balance in the cell is achieved by subtracting 14.73 Sv. Such contribution is identified as the Indonesian Throughflow and Bering Strait contributions together (ITF/BS). In the Southern Hemisphere, the total heat transport estimation includes the ITF/BS contribution (1.69 PW), while the shallow overturning term is zero by construction. (b) Zonally-integrated transport for different density classes within each water mass classified according to its ventilation level. The Upper transport refers to the sum of all fluxes within the Shallow Overturning Cell (poleward WBC plus equatorward interior flow, excluding the surface term). Other terms refer to meridional mass transports below the cell. Vertical arrows indicate the mass transfer between water classes and heat transports that go with the mass balances, assuming the transfer occurs preferentially between most adjacent layers. Any heat exchange which does not imply mass exchange is indicated as a white arrow.
