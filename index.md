## Welcome to my webpage

My name is Rene' Gabriel Navarro Labastida
I am a  Ph.D. student at University of Trieste, currently working with ocean general circulation with emphasis on ocean heat uptake.

I am currently enrolled in the third year of the ***Joint PhD Programme, Earth Science and Fluid Mechanics*** (_UniT-ICTP_) in Trieste, Italy. The aim of my project is to evaluate the response of the global ocean climate to anomalous surface fluxes in terms of ocean heat uptake and circulation changes.
The main focus of the study the determination of the low latitude ocean heat budgets and the role of the shallow overturning circulation in the Pacific Ocean.
So far, I have done an exhaustive analysis of a set of numerical simulations following a state-of-art forcing protocol for Ocean General Circulation Models [fafmip](http://www.fafmip.org/). At the moment I am preparing a scientific paper encompassing the main results of the study.

I have \textbf{Undergraduate studies in Oceanography} with emphasis on the technical and interdisciplinary skills development on ocean-atmosphere physics.
Additionally, I have studied in a ***Post-graduated Program on Master in Science of Physical Oceanography***, with strong focus on fluid dynamics, applied mathematics, statistics and programming. As work experience I was member of the ***Oceanographic Observational Network System*** (cigom.info) and the ***Mexican Center for Innovation in Ocean Energy*** for the ***wave-current interactions*** group and _Regional wave energy chapter_, respectively. My duty in both cases was to support statistical and programming analysis, particularly in the estimation of climatological patterns, long-term trends and extreme value theory.
